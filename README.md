# DeepQSpaceInvaders

The goal of the project was to develop a model which uses both CNN's and Q-Learning to leverage Deep Q Learning to train an agent to incrementally improve their gameplay. 

## Getting Started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Clone the repo and run the notebook on your own machine! Make sure that you have a Geforce Gtx 680 or higher. 

## Testing

Make sure the number of games is set to 50 since by then the Epsilon value would decay to 0.05 and purely exploit the enviroment.
